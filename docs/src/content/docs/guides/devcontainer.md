title: Setting up a Dev Container
description: Generate a minimal .devcontainer/devcontainer.json for your project using an AI prompt
---

`boboddy work` spins up a Docker container from your project's `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` for every step execution. This page provides a prompt you can paste into any AI coding assistant (Claude, Copilot, etc.) to generate a minimal, project-appropriate devcontainer config.

## AI prompt

Copy the prompt below and run it in your project's root directory. The AI will inspect your codebase and output a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` (and a `Dockerfile` if needed).

````
You are helping me create a minimal `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` for this project so it can be used as a Boboddy worker execution environment.

**Your goal:** produce the smallest devcontainer config that gives the execution environment everything it needs — nothing more.

**Step 1 — Analyse the codebase**

Examine the following files (read whichever exist):

- `package.json` / `bun.lock` / `yarn.lock` / `pnpm-lock.yaml` — runtime, package manager, scripts
- `Dockerfile` / `docker-compose.yml` — existing base image choices
- `.nvmrc` / `.node-version` / `.tool-versions` — pinned runtimes
- `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt` / `Pipfile` — Python deps
- `go.mod` — Go version
- `Cargo.toml` — Rust toolchain
- `*.sln` / `*.csproj` — .NET version
- Any CI config (`.github/workflows/`, `.circleci/`, etc.) — look for `uses: actions/setup-*` or `apt-get install` lines

**Step 2 — Determine the environment**

From your analysis, identify:

1. **Primary runtime** and its minimum required version (e.g. Node 20, Python 3.11, Go 1.22)
2. **Package manager** (npm / yarn / pnpm / bun / pip / cargo / go)
3. **System packages** genuinely required at runtime (not just for local dev convenience)
4. **Any secrets or environment variables** the code reads — note them as comments; do not hardcode values

**Step 3 — Choose a base**

- Prefer an official [Dev Container base image](https://mcr.microsoft.com/en-us/artifact/mar/devcontainers/) that matches the primary runtime.
- If the project already has a `Dockerfile`, use it as the base (`"build": { "dockerfile": "../Dockerfile" }`).
- Only write a custom `Dockerfile` if no suitable base image exists.

**Step 4 — Write the config**

Output:

1. `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` — include only the fields you actually need:
   - `name` — short human-readable name
   - `image` or `build` — base image or Dockerfile path
   - `features` — Dev Container Features for any additional tooling (e.g. git, docker-in-docker). Use the `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/` namespace. Omit features already present in the base image.
   - `containerEnv` — environment variables that must be set (use placeholder values like `"${localEnv:MY_SECRET}"` for secrets)
   - `onCreateCommand` — dependency install command if needed (e.g. `npm ci`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
   - `remoteUser` — set to a non-root user if the base image provides one

2. If you wrote a custom `Dockerfile`, output it as `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`.

**Rules:**
- Do NOT include VS Code-specific fields (`customizations`, `extensions`, `settings`) — this container is used for headless agent execution, not interactive development.
- Do NOT add tools "just in case" — every layer adds startup latency.
- Do NOT hard-code secret values.
- If the project needs to run Docker commands (e.g. it builds or runs containers itself), prefer the `docker-outside-of-docker` feature (`ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-outside-of-docker`) over `docker-in-docker` — it mounts the host Docker socket rather than running a nested daemon, which is faster and uses less memory.
- Prefer `onCreateCommand` for install steps over baking dependencies into a custom image, unless the install is very slow.
- Add a short comment above each non-obvious field explaining why it is there.

Output the file(s) using code fences with the file path as the language identifier, for example:

````.devcontainer/devcontainer.json
{ ... }
````

After the file output, add a **"Why"** section (plain prose, ≤ 150 words) explaining your base image choice and any non-obvious decisions.
````

## What to do with the output

1. Create a `.devcontainer/` directory at your project root if it doesn't exist.
2. Write the generated `devcontainer.json` (and optional `Dockerfile`) into that directory.
3. Commit both files.
4. Test locally by running `boboddy work --once` — the worker will pull the image and report any missing tools in its logs.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---------|--------------|
| `boboddy work` fails with "image not found" | Base image name is wrong or private — check `docker pull <image>` manually |
| Agent can't find the package manager | Add an `onCreateCommand` to install deps, or use a `features` entry |
| Container starts but step fails with missing binary | A system package or runtime tool is absent — add it via `features` or a custom `Dockerfile` |
| Execution is slow | The `onCreateCommand` runs on every job; move stable deps into the image |
